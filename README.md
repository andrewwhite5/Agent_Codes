# Agent Codes

The purpose of this project is to simplify the process for organizing agent
data in regards to time spent in various codes on phone software.

Agent_Unavailable_Time.py pulls from 4 Excel spreadsheets that are
remotely downloaded from inContact (phone software). It reorganizes the data
into a usable format for our Business Desk.

Export.py exports that data as two separate Excel spreadsheets.

Graphs.py creates visualizations for use by Leadership.
