"# Agent_Codes"

The purpose of this project is to simplify the process for organizing agent
data in regards to time spend in various codes on phone software.

The Agent_Unavailable_Time.py file pulls from 4 Excel spreadsheets that are
remotely downloaded from inContact (phone software). It reorganizes the data
into a usable format for our Business Desk and exports that data as two
separate Excel spreadsheets.

The Graphs.py file creates visualizations for use by Leadership.
